# canvas-game
A simple game I'm making in canvas.

Hopefully a worlds hardest game clone.

The level layouts are in levels.js.
A "0" is a blank space
A "1" is a wall
A "2" is a checkpoint
A "4" is where you want the player to spawn in a checkpoint (They also act as checkpoints)
A "5" is where the player starts the level (They also act as "4"s)
A "6" is where the player ends the level (They also act as "4"s)
Only have one 5 and 6 per level
Each array in the list is a level
